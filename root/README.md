- Medical Test Recommendations

## Folder Structure
- `/models/`: Trained machine learning models
- `/data/`: Raw and processed datasets
- `/app/`: Python scripts for model inference
- `README.md`: This file
- `final_project_report.pdf`: Project report (optional)

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - joblib
  - imbalanced-learn
  - streamlit (optional for web app)

## How to Run
